This is a newly created file for CS131's kenken Prolog assignment. It
should supersede the one created on my Mac Mini.

* GNU Prolog Finite Domain Solver
The first implementation of ~kenken/3~ will use GNU's finite domain
solver. 
#+BEGIN_SRC prolog :tangle kenken.pl
  kenken(N,C,T) :-
      N >= 0,
      constraints(C).

  constraints([]).
#+END_SRC
