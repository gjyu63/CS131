** Programming language types

In this class we will partition programming languages into three types:
1. Imperative languages
2. Functional languages (declarative languages)
3. Logic languages

Thus, with these divisions in mind, we will cover five languages:
1. Java
2. Python
3. Scheme
4. ML
5. Prolog
